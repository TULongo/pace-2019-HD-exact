## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running 
on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

In order to compile this solver you need a C++ compiler supporting C++14.

### Installing

Compile the programs by running make in the root directory.

```
make
```

This creates the binary `detkdecomp` in the same directory.
